# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Research Projects

Hello, I'm Natnael Tilahun,

Within this repository, I've shared some of my projects where I've led and contributed to various domains of Machine Learning and Deep Learning research. I also have several other projects in progress, which I plan to upload in the future. In this repository, you'll find the following projects:

## 1. Amharic Handwritten and Machine Printed Character Recognition Using CNN via Random Search Hyperparameter Optimization Algorithm

This project involves the development of a character recognition model for Amharic handwritten and machine-printed text using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We've employed the Random Search hyperparameter optimization algorithm to fine-tune the model. Please note that as this project has been submitted to a journal and is currently in the preprint stage, we cannot provide the full experimentation details until the paper is published.

## 2. Disease Detection via Convolutional Neural Network with Models Built from Scratch and Using Pretrained Models

In this project, we have created a model for the detection of diseases in wheat and potato crops using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). One noteworthy outcome is the development of an Android application capable of real-time potato disease detection. This project showcases our ability to build disease detection models, both from the ground up and by utilizing pretrained models.

## 3. Detection of Structured Query Language Injection via Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms

This project focuses on the detection of Structured Query Language (SQL) Injection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. SQL Injection is a critical security vulnerability that can have serious consequences, and our work here contributes to making web applications more secure.

## 4. Datasets

For each project, we have prepared datasets. Some of these datasets have been collected from real-world environments, while others have been sourced from various reputable sources. However, please note that due to the large size of some datasets, we were unable to upload them directly to this GitHub repository. If you require access to a specific dataset, please feel free to reach out, and we'll be happy to provide further details on how to obtain it.

Thank you for visiting this repository. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on any of these projects, please don't hesitate to contact me.
